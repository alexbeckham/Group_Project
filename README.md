## Goal
In this project we compare the oil and gas industry with the Alternative Energy industry in terms of production and stock prices in order to evaluate which industry is the best performer.


## Measuring Sticks
### Assumptions:
Equilibrium between supply and demand exists and that production (supply) is at an equilibrium with consumption (demand).
    * Basically a higher production(supply) would mean that there is a higher demand for that product.

We decided to measure performance in a few different ways:

1) Rate of change in production:
    * Which industry is producing the most energy.
        * "Which industry has a higher demand?"
2) Rate of change in stock portfolios:
    * Which industry do investors have a better outlook on?
3) Standard deviation in rate of change of production.
    * "Which industry has the most stable supply?"
3) Standard deviation in rate of change of portfolio returns.
    * "Which industry has been more risky to invest in historically?"

## The Ideal Winner
The ideal winner would be the industry that is growing the fastest, has the best outlook in the eyes of investors, and has the lowest risk for each unit of growth.
